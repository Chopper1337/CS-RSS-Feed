      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3469488996658509791?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Today's update includes an adjustment to the Active Duty map pool as well as some weapon adjustments.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/3381077/00057c6cfafc95cb56238d670a4d2751969158d7.png"/><br/><br/>For starters, we're making changes to the Active Duty map pool, which will determine which maps get played at the 2023 Paris Major.<br/><br/>Anubis is being added to Active Duty and and Dust2 is being removed. But both maps are still available in Casual, Deathmatch, and Competitive modes.<br/><br/>We're also making some adjustments to weapons. The AWP has had its magazine size reduced to five bullets (so make them count!), and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long ranges. <br/><br/>Try the changes out and let us know what you think!<br/><br/>And thanks for the blog post title, Ryan on Twitter (@Schaffurr)!]]></description>

Congratulations to the winners!<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">Maps</div>You've been patient, and it's finally here.

For the next week (until Monday, August 22nd), CS:GO players with Prime status can grab their birthday coin by earning enough XP for their first in-game drop of the week.<br/><br/>Ten years. It's a big number, yet CS:GO is stronger than ever. Over the past 12 months alone, we've seen more players than ever before (averaging over 20 million monthly unique players), record viewership for Majors (2.7m concurrent viewers), and massive community support with over $70 million raised for professional organizations, teams, and players. The future could not look brighter.<br/><br/>Happy Birthday, CS:GO.]]></description>
