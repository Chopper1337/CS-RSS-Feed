      <title>Counter-Strike 2 Update</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[[ DAMAGE PREDICTION ][list]
[*] Added damage prediction settings. Damage prediction allows clients to immediately play the audio/visual effects of inflicting damage without waiting for confirmation from the server. Damage prediction can make shooting feel significantly more responsive, but comes with the risk of occasionally being wrong (e.g. due to aim punch, tagging, or a death that your client isn't yet aware of).
[*] Predicted body shot effects (disabled by default), head shot effects (disabled by default), and kill ragdolls (enabled by default) can each be toggled separately.
[*] Damage prediction is not active when you have high ping.
[/list]
[ ANIMATION ][list]
[*] Updated the third-person animation that plays when a player is blinded by a flashbang. The animation now accurately represents the player's visibility level, and the pose will only show the player's arm covering their eyes when they are completely blinded.
[*] Fixed a case where legs weren't animating correctly while taking damage.
[/list]
[ GRAPHICS ][list]
[*] Added ambient occlusion for first person legs to better ground them in the environment.
[*] Performance optimizations for molotov and incendiary effects.
[/list]
[ GRENADES ][list]
[*] Added axis labels to the grenade line-up reticle tick marks.
[*] The grenade preview camera now shows the result of a jump throw while the jump button is held.
[/list]
[ MAP GUIDES ][list]
[*] Added a map guide for Train, which demonstrates four simple Terrorist grenade line-ups. To load a map guide, go to PlayâPractice and toggle "Load Map Guides" on.
[*]Added concommands annotation_* which enable the creation, saving, and loading of map guide nodes and files, which are stored in /annotations/.
[/list]
[ MISC ][list]
[*] New game settings for radar map blending and background opacity.
[*] Fixed a case where progress from a previously completed Armory Pass would show during activation of a new pass.
[*] Fixed a regression with Chinese input via the Microsoft Input Methods.
[*] CSTV now allows setting tv_delay and tv_delay1 to a value smaller than 6 seconds.
[*] Charm Template number is now available in Charm descriptions.
[/list]

      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[[ NETWORK ]
[list]
[*] Fixed a case mid-spray where lag compensation wasn't aware of the user's "Buffering to smooth over packet loss / jitter" setting.
[*] Improved clock synchronization to better handle downstream jitter bursts.
[/list]

[ TELEMETRY HUD ]
[list]
[*] Changed the method for measuring network quality to measure how much network is negatively impacting gameplay. It now measures how often a tick is missed due to network loss or jitter.
[*] Added detailed network quality display option, which can be used to display the raw packet loss and jitter numbers.
[*] For more details see [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5E6F-5B36-5485-F6B9]this article[/url].
[/list]

[ ABOUT THE NETWORK QUALITY READOUT ]
Prior to the Armory Update, the network quality readout in the telemetry HUD considered packets to be "bad" under two circumstances.  1.) If the packet was dropped.  2.) If the packet was delivered out-of-order and was not corrected at a relatively low layer in the network stack.  This was not a useful metric for two reasons.  First, it counted some misdelivery events as "bad" even though they did not negatively impact gameplay.  This was especially a problem for packet reordering.  Second, it was not counting as "bad" packets that arrived late due to network jitter and [i]did[/i] negatively impact gameplay.  After debugging many instances of gameplay hitches with players, we determined that jitter was causing problems for many players, who believed (quite reasonably) that their network was working perfectly, since there was no packet loss.

In an attempt to let these players know that jitter might be the cause of the hitches, we changed the measurement method in the Armory Update on October 2, 2024.  Now, we counted a message as "bad" if it was lost, if packets arrived out of order in a way that could not be corrected, or if the packets experienced jitter above a threshold.  For players on a network connection with significant jitter, suddenly the network quality indicator became significantly worse.  Many players assumed that this meant that something had changed to introduce packet loss.

Unfortunately, this method of measuring quality was also flawed.  The Source 2 Engine automatically adds buffering to smooth over jitter.  For many players, these automatic adjustments are enough, and the indicator was counting jittered packets as "bad" even when there was not negative impact on gameplay.

Today's update changes the network quality readout to only measure network events that are negatively impacting gameplay.  See the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/5E6F-5B36-5485-F6B9]FAQ[/url] for more details.]]></description>

[ NETWORKING ]
[list]
[*] Added telemetry option to display graphs of network jitter and misdelivery
[*] Changed how packet misdelivery is measured. Previously, if packets arrived out of order, this could be counted as misdelivery even if it was corrected and did not impact gameplay. Also, jitter was not considered, even though excessive jitter can disrupt smooth gameplay. The new measurement method will only count reordered packets as misdelivered if they impact gameplay. Furthermore, if network jitter exceeds a threshold where gameplay is affected, the packets are counted as misdelivered even if they are not dropped and arrive in order

[*] Practice matches and matches started with the "map" command will now run in engine loopback mode to match the CS:GO offline default. Engine loopback bypasses most networking code for the host, resulting in one less tick of latency for the local player. Engine loopback can be disabled by appending "loopback=0" to the map command-line (e.g. "map de_dust2 loopback=0").

      <title>Steam Game Recording Beta Now Available</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Sharing your favorite CS2 moments just got a whole lot easier. Introducing Game Recording, a new built-in Steam feature that lets you clip your clutch kills and ridiculous spray transfers with the click of a few buttons.

Game Recording saves your gameplay by recording in the background (or by pressing a hotkey), so you can play it back any time you want--even while you're still playing. CS2 recordings will feature a timeline auto-filled with game-defined markers (like kills and deaths), but you can add your own markers at any time.

Want to join the Game Recording beta? Click the link below for more details!

[*] Added a Settings Recommendation popup if your display's refresh rate is set below its maximum at startup. Using your display's highest refresh rate is generally recommended.
[*] Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync support is detected but not enabled at startup. Using G-Sync is generally recommended if your system supports it.
[*] Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync is enabled but not V-Sync and/or NVIDIA Reflex. It is generally recommended to enable all three settings together when they are available. Note that applying these settings will limit your frame rate to your display's refresh rate or slightly lower, which is usually the smoothest-looking and lowest input latency settings combination. See [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/418E-7A04-B0DA-9032]https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/418E-7A04-B0DA-9032[/url] for technical details.[/list][*] Removed "Main Menu Background Scenery" and "Item Inspect Background Scenery" settings from the Video Settings page.

[*] The "Refresh Rate" setting now shows your display's current refresh rate in Windowed and Fullscreen Windowed modes.
[*] Removed the "Laptop Power Savings" setting which has never actually been configurable in CS2.
[*] Added a "Frame Pacing" section to the Advanced Video settings page.
[*] Added an "NVIDIA G-Sync" row to the Frame Pacing section which tells you whether or not G-Sync is active with your current display settings. This row may be hidden if you're using the Vulkan renderer or if you're not using an NVIDIA graphics card.
[*] Added "Maximum FPS In Game" and "Maximum FPS In Menus" sliders to the Frame Pacing section. These control the fps_max and fps_max_ui convars respectively.
[*] Increased the default "Maximum FPS In Menus" setting from 120 FPS to 200 FPS.
[*] The Advanced Video visual preview now uses the "In Game" maximum FPS instead of the "In Menus" maximum.
